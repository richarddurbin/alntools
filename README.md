utilities for processing .1aln files from FastGA, FasTAN etc.

Make with `make` and install with `make install`.  If you want to install elsewhere than the default `~/bin` directory then `make DESTDIR=/your/preferred/location`.

Currently there are two programs:

## tanbed

converts a .1aln file generated by [FasTAN](https://github.com/thegenemyers/FASTAN) into a [BED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BED_(file_format)) file.  Example usage is: 

```
> tanbed mGorGor-tan.1aln > mGorGor-tan.bed
read GDB from mGorGor-tan.1aln : 26 seqs 28 contigs (2 gaps), totSeq 3545850636 totCtg 3543850636 (99.944%)
processed 636143 alignments total length 708296862 from mGorGor-tan.1aln length 3545850636 (20.0 %)
```

## gdbmask

masks a .1gdb file as used by [FastGA -M](https://github.com/thegenemyers/FASTGA) with a bed file, as for example generated by **tanbed** from [FasTAN](https://github.com/thegenemyers/FASTAN) output.  Example usage is: 

```
> gdbmask mGorGor.1gdb mGorGor-tan.bed
read GDB from mGorGor.1gdb : 26 seqs 28 contigs (2 gaps), totSeq 3545850636 totCtg 3543850636 (99.944%)
read 636143 bed lines from mGorGor-tan.bed
wrote GDB to mGorGor.1gdb : 26 seqs 28 contigs (2 gaps), totSeq 3545850636 totCtg 3543850636 (99.944%), 636143 masks totMask 708296862 (20.0%)
!! rerun GIXmake mGorGor.1gdb to apply new mask
```

Note that, as requested in the final line of the output, you need to run GIXmake again from the [FastGA package](https://github.com/thegenemyers/FASTGA) in order for this masking to take effect in subsequent `FastGA` runs, and you also need to remember to set the `-M` option for "use soft Masks" when running `FastGA`.

By default `gdbmask` overwrites the given `.1gdb` file.  If you wish to keep that and write a new `.1gdb` file then you can use option `[-o newfile.1gdb]`, but for downstream tools to subsequently use the resulting `newfile.1gdb` you will need to create by copying (or linking) a corresponding hidden `.newname.bps` file that contains the 2-bit compressed sequence.
